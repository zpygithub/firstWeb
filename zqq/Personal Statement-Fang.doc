Personal Statement

With the rapid development of e-commerce and widespread globalization, logistics is greatly flourishing to play an irreplaceable role in guaranteeing international trade. It is also being challenged due to tough competition as well as immature corporate management system in China. As learning more about the field of logistics and its huge impact on economy, I increasingly feel the urge to study and practice deeply. Standing in a crossroad facing the coming graduation, I prefer to devote myself to further study along with my strong interest and great determination. 

I like logistics even when I was a little girl. It’s my father, a post office staff, who inspired my first interest through introducing me what is logistics and the distinctive story behind every package. I was fascinated by logistics’ operational principles and substantial functions of connecting the world to strengthen people’s interpersonal relationship. The attraction that logistics has brought to me initiated my desire to explore the mysterious world.

Later on, my outstanding performance in University Entrance Exam pushed me to the height of admission into one of China's top universities, Soochow University, a place that is a major cradle of top level talents. Motivated by my strong willingness to embrace challenges in the arena of logistics, I thus unhesitatingly chose Logistics Management as my major. With more than three years of undergraduate training, I have laid stalwart foundation in acquiring necessary principles and independent thinking ability. Attached importance to advanced courses, I established a complete and systematic academic framework. The case-oriented teaching mode not only immensely drew my attention to the link between logistics and supply chain, but also cultivated my capability of planning supply chain operation according to marketing. Devotion to my major course study won me No.5 rank in the 82-student class and a maintained overall GPA of 3.5, against the strict grading system and keen competition. 

Besides rigorous studying, I never missed any chance to excel myself in an all-around way. Engaging in logistics relevant research with field investigation and marketing analysis based on customer requirement, I successfully figured out appropriate logistic models to achieve the betterment of management. My experience in research project of the United States and Other Developed Countries’ Manufacturing Backflow provided me with new perspectives about logistics management. Acting as a team leader, I did work plans for every member, made decisions for various things and coordinated the working schedule to ensure the research go on without barriers. The risks of backflow was proved with methods like comparative analysis, demonstration analysis and information consultation. While the consequent proposition that concentrated on how to avoid the risks, calls for the applicable solution, which is exactly what I want to continually research in postgraduate study. 


Inspiration through various extra-curriculum activities and internship is another valuable thing in my college life. These practice work bestowed on me the abilities of analytic skills, creativity and management. To name but a few, with the sense of social responsibility, I joined volunteer activities like “Suzhou City Assessment Activity”. Applying logistical theories to figure out the most efficient assessment itinerary, my investigation report has received significant success of favoring the urban environment and reducing the management cost. Another experience engraved in my mind was interning in an international trade company. I learned a lot about solving problems about time and space in freight, and the management and control of product supply chain. In the meantime, I found that there were still a lot existing problems beyond my theoretic knowledge, which triggered my keen desire to deepen my knowledge and comprehension of logistics and management.
 
Logistics and Supply Chain Management represents the field in which I can achieve satisfying personal development. XXX at XXX is designed to enable student to be equally compatible with logistics strategy, the management of logistics operations, and engineering skills such as facility design and implementation of logistics technology, which extremely attracts me. I believe XXX is the best place for me to grow successfully and benefit my future career to be a logistics expert. In future master program, I hope not only gain all-rounded logistics knowledge but have the opportunity to make friends all around the world with the same interests. I would be most grateful if you could give my application into your favorable consideration.
