Personal Statement
There must be an inspiring thing that drives a boy to make up his own dream. To me, it is fulfillment of winning my first city-level award in science field at 10 years old spurred me to explore more in the fascinating area. With high enthusiasm and a determined spirit to keep going forward, I sincerely submit my application for admission into your esteemed university.

Thanks to my parents, two computer professionals, who put emphasis on providing me with a free environment, I am able to develop real interest. Seldom giving any direct education to me, but encouraging me to learn through trying what I am curious about, my parents have simulated me to conduct kinds of rudimentary computer intelligence experiments and attend abundant contests, achieving several inventions and kinds of awards. And their westernized education methods not only cultivated my abilities of independent thinking and innovative thoughts, but also originated my determination to study abroad to broaden my horizons and enhance all round capabilities.

After entering high school, my thirst for knowledge is satisfied by tons of books in school library, knowledgeable teachers and excellent atmosphere of practice. Devoted to the subjects learning, especially mathematics, physics and chemistry, I have laid academic foundation for future study. Moreover, not confined myself to knowledge from class, I have been intentionally taking part in a broad range of activities. Owing to my deep interest, I set up my own robot club and successfully expanded the team from 6 to 35 people within one year. As the director, I arrange the training schedule, assign tasks according to members’ advantages and fight hard to get the qualification for robot competitions. In the competitions, besides making strategies, programming and debugging machines, I need to cope with emergencies and assist every group’s competition events. Until now, I have led the team to receive two provincial prizes and one national award, together with one international competition qualification. Worth of saying, our school started to give location and financial support due to our good performance, which is a great encouragement and acknowledgment of our efforts. Through what I have done in the club, I have developed an outstanding capability in leadership, organization, communication and coordination. And I consider this would be my precious experience that I could share with my future classmates.

Canada provides with comfortable and open-minded study environment, encouraging the innovation and exploration. On the other hand, its world-class teaching resources permits better academic development and great job opportunities. Thus, I would like to apply for a chance to study in Canada. And University of Windsor is my dream place with its eminent reputation, admirable faculty, and the elite students from all over the world. I firmly believe that studying there can equip me with international vision and cutting edge research technologies which would benefit for my future career in computer science field a lot. If I could have the chance to study in your University, I would do my best to cherish the valuable opportunity.
