01:29:31	Anthony Anderson	Yea. Let's get straight to the point Nicole. Did you grow up with any pets?	例：嗯。直接进入正题吧，妮可。你养过什么宠物吗？
			
01:29:36	Nicole Sullivan	Yeah, lots of pets, lots of pets. Lived in Manhattan with pets and then I got bribed with a dog, to go upstate New York. I mean they were gonna take me there anyway, it doesn't matter what I said.	
			
01:29:46	Anthony Anderson	Alright.	
			
01:29:47	Nicole Sullivan	When you're 12 you don't say. And then we had a farm where there... it was, we were like, "well let's have a farm." But all we have is cats. So many cats. 	
			
01:29:55	Anthony Anderson	Okay.	
			
01:29:56	Nicole Sullivan	So many cats.	
			
01:29:57	Anthony Anderson	I've never heard of a farm with only cats.	
			
01:30:02	Nicole Sullivan	And...	
			
01:30:02	Anthony Anderson	Can it still be just called a farm?	
			
01:30:05	Nicole Sullivan	Well that's where... there's bar... there's endless amounts of barns. Like we could've have had 800 head of cattle, and we had 300 cats and then some chickens. 	
			
01:30:13	Anthony Anderson	Really, okay. 	
			
01:30:14	Tina the Brain Coral	A cat farm.	
			
01:30:15	Nicole Sullivan	A cat farm.	
			
01:30:15	Anthony Anderson	A cat farm with chickens.	
			
01:30:17	Nicole Sullivan	With chickens.	
			
01:30:18	Tina the Brain Coral	Okay. Chickens and cats?	
			
01:30:20	Nicole Sullivan	We wanted to keep it legit, so we added chickens in. Like, well we're a real farm, we had chickens.	
			
01:30:24	Anthony Anderson	Alright. Well I grew up in the hood and we had alley cats.	
			
01:30:29	Nicole Sullivan	Yeah, yeah, yeah.	
			
01:30:29	Anthony Anderson	Yeah. What's the difference between an alley cat and a barn cat?	
			
01:30:37	Nicole Sullivan	Very little. Very little.	
			
01:30:39	Anthony Anderson	Okay.	
			
01:30:40	Nicole Sullivan	Alley cats have a little more snaggle tooth to them. They got a little more, like <WINKS>. 	
			
01:30:43	Anthony Anderson	Oh hold on, hold on. 	
			
01:30:46	Nicole Sullivan	They're like...	
			
01:30:46	Anthony Anderson	So this is snaggle tooth. That has nothing to do with the mouth.	
			
01:30:49	Nicole Sullivan	I was trying to lick my lip <LAUGHS>. 	
			
01:30:51	Anthony Anderson	Oh, okay, okay.	
			
01:30:52	Nicole Sullivan	And my eye went instead.	
			
01:30:53	Anthony Anderson	So you're saying cats from the hood have no dental plan, but cats upstate New York on the farm. Okay.	
			
01:30:59	Nicole Sullivan	I mean listen... No I, I, 'cause I have two... a feral cat now that's now in my house, but... and she is still, she is still no fun. But, no the cats would si... so we would, we'd have to go find the kittens, 'cause if you don't get them in time then they become feral. At a certain point, if you don't get to a kitten fast enough they're untameable to a large extent, and then they're on their own, and then you can't adopt them into a house.	
			
01:31:21	Anthony Anderson	Okay, so when that happens on the farm...	
			
01:31:24	Nicole Sullivan	Yeah.	
			
01:31:25	Anthony Anderson	...what do you do to the feral c?	
			
01:31:26	Nicole Sullivan	You don't do anything. You never see them. They disappear. They... you just feed 'em and then they move away from you. But you gotta get to the kittens fast, and we find all the kittens. And there was this one kitten I fell in love with. And I called her Tasher 'cause it was French for spotted, 'cause I thought I was really cool. 	
			
01:31:41	Anthony Anderson	Tasher? 	
			
01:31:41	Nicole Sullivan	Tasher. It's French for spot. 	
			
01:31:43	Anthony Anderson	That's not really French. There was a girl I grew up with and... on the block named Tasher.	
			
01:31:47	Tina the Brain Coral	Yeah.	
			
01:31:48	Anthony Anderson	She was far from French. She had corn rows and a finger wave at the same time.	
			
01:31:53	Audience	<LAUGHS>. 	
			
01:31:54	Tina the Brain Coral	Yeah.	
			
01:31:54	Nicole Sullivan	She wasn't French, she wasn't from France?	
			
01:31:55	Anthony Anderson	No. No.	
			
01:31:56	Tina the Brain Coral	I met her.	
			
01:31:57	Anthony Anderson	She had French tipped fingernails, but yes. Tina, is Tasher French?	
			
01:32:02	Tina the Brain Coral	No. She is not French. She's gangster.	
			
01:32:04	Anthony Anderson	No not at all.	
			
01:32:06	Anthony Anderson	We had a girl in the audience at another show and she said her name was French. I said, "what's your name?" She said, "T'erica."	
			
01:32:11	Audience	<LAUGHS>. 	
			
01:32:12	Tina the Brain Coral	Yeah.	
			
01:32:12	Anthony Anderson	T'er... remember T'erica, Tina?	
			
01:32:13	Tina the Brain Coral	Mhm. I remember that. Mhm.	
			
01:32:15	Anthony Anderson	Okay.	
			
01:32:16	Nicole Sullivan	T'erica?	
			
01:32:16	Anthony Anderson	Yeah. But, okay, go on about your French named cat, Tasher.	
			
01:32:19	Nicole Sullivan	My French cat... well my mom said, "you can bring her in the house," 'cause the cats are outside. And so she was my house cat, and I loved her, loved her, loved her. But she was alright. And then I moved to college and my mom surprised me at college. She was like, "guess what I brought for you? Your cat from home."
